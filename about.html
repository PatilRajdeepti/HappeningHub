        <h2>About HappeningHub</h2>
        <p>At HappeningHub, we believe that every student deserves equal access to opportunities that can shape their future. Whether it's a hackathon, a startup competition, a cultural fest, or a career seminar, students often miss out on valuable events simply because they are unaware of them.

          We aim to revolutionize event discovery for students by providing personalized recommendations based on their interests, skills, and location. With AI-driven suggestions and real-time updates, HappeningHub ensures that students never miss out on an event that could help them grow academically, professionally, or socially. Our platform is designed to be intuitive, efficient, and accessible, making it easier than ever to browse, filter, and register for events with just a few clicks..</p>
