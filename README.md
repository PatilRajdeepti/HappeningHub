# HappeningHub – Smart Event Discovery Platform

HappeningHub is a **student-focused event discovery platform** that helps users find **hackathons, competitions, college fests, and entertainment events** based on their **interests and location**.  
It aims to ensure students never miss opportunities by providing **real-time updates, filtering options, and personalized recommendations**.


# Problem Statement
Many students miss out on valuable opportunities because:
- Events are spread across multiple platforms.  
- Existing platforms are **category-specific** or lack **personalization**.  
- Students often hear about events **too late**.  

This project was born from our own experience of missing hackathons and fests due to the lack of a centralized platform.


# Solution
A **centralized web platform** where students can:
- Discover events based on **location & interest**.  
- Save/bookmark events and set reminders.  
- Get **real-time updates** about ongoing/upcoming events.  
- Receive **AI-powered personalized recommendations** (future scope).
